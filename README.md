## Artificial Intelligence Projects
#### Here is a respository of my code created from the CAP6635 Artificial Intelligence Course from FAU.

#### For homework 1, We had to take a 5x5 board and expand it to a 6x6 board to have three types of agents navigate the board to clean any spots that are dirty (which are the white spaces). The three types of agents are:

### 1. Simple Reflex Agent

- These types of agents are based on condition-action rules and are stateless devices.
- They have no memory of past world states and have no specific objective/goal.

### 2. Model-Based Reflex Agent

- These agents have internal states that are used to keep track of past states of the world.

### 3. Goal-Based Agents

- In addition to state information, the agent also has goal information that describes situations that the agent wants to carry out.
- Agents can take future events into consideration.

#### I created a file called Homework 1 that contains three separate source code files for all three of the agents. Now here is a description of what each of the three seprate source code files do once you run them:
