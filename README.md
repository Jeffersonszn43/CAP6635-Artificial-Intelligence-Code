## Artificial Intelligence Projects
#### Here is a respository of my code created from the CAP6635 Artificial Intelligence Course from FAU.

#### For homework 1, We had to take a 5x5 board and expand it to a 6x6 board to have three types of agents navigate the board to clean any spots that are dirty (which are the white spaces). The three types of agents are:

### 1. Simple Reflex Agent

- These types of agents are based on condition-action rules and are stateless devices.
- They have no memory of past world states and have no specific objective/goal.
- The agent only checks the previous and current states to determine their next action.
